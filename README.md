# Algorithms Portfolio - C# (Columbia College Chicago)<br><br>
<br>

Welcome to my Portfolio for the Algorithms class at Columbia College Chicago. 


  >This repository showcases various algorithmic implementations and problem-solving techniques developed in C#. 
  These projects are designed to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental and advanced algorithmic concepts, 
  along with clean code practices and efficient problem-solving approaches.

<br>
<h3>4. Maze Game</h3>

>This is a simple console-based maze game implemented in C#. The goal of the game is to navigate a character through a 10x10 maze from a starting point to an exit point, avoiding walls along the way.

<h3>5. Data Structure</h3> 

>This console application demonstrates the use of common data structures in C#, including arrays, stacks, queues, and dictionaries.

<h3>6. Sorting Random Numbers</h3> 

>This program provides a clear demonstration of basic sorting algorithms with step-by-step output, making it suitable for learning and understanding sorting techniques.

<br>
<h3>7. Sorting Numbers</h3> 

>This project demonstrates six common sorting algorithms implemented in C#. It uses a dataset of 474 scores from a text file (scores.txt) and sorts them using each algorithm. The project also measures the performance of each algorithm in terms of execution time.

<h3>8. Searching MVC website</h3> 

>This project implemented in MVC website and demonstrates six common searching algorithms implemented in C#. It uses a dataset of 474 scores from a text file (scores.txt) and sorts them using each algorithm.

<br>
<h3>8. Tree Structures</h3> 

>This project demonstrates the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) using C#. The application loads a dataset of scores from a text file, sorts the scores, inserts them into a BST, and performs various tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, and post-order).

<h3>9. Maze Game Part 2</h3> 

>The game includes an AI solver that uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to navigate the maze from the starting point to the exit.
