  # Algorithms Portfolio - C# (Columbia College Chicago)

<br>

>This portfolio showcases a diverse collection of projects that highlight my expertise in algorithm design, data structures, and software development using C#. Through these projects, I have demonstrated a deep understanding of fundamental concepts like Big O notation and runtime analysis, as well as practical skills in implementing algorithms such as sorting, searching, and pathfinding. I have explored data structures, including stacks, queues, and binary search trees, while applying these structures to solve complex problems efficiently. My work also includes creative projects like grid-based games, recursive logic implementations, and randomized algorithms, reflecting my ability to combine theory with practical application. Additionally, I have developed console-based and graphical applications, illustrating my adaptability across different programming paradigms and environments. Together, these projects represent a comprehensive skill set in computational thinking, problem-solving, and clean coding practices.
