# Building An ExponentMethod

## Pseudocode

```bash
  Algorithm Main
    Print "Base Number in the Power Number"
    Print GetPow(3, 4)
End Algorithm

Algorithm GetPow(baseNum, powNum)
    Precondition:
        baseNum is an integer
        powNum is a non-negative integer
    Postcondition:
        Returns baseNum raised to the power of powNum

    result <- 1
    For i <- 0 to powNum - 1
        result <- result * baseNum
    End For
    Return result
End Algorithm

```

### Precondition
- baseNum is an integer.
- powNum is a non-negative integer.

### Postcondition
- The function returns baseNum raised to the power of powNum.


According to Big O notation

### Best Case Runtime
The best case occurs when powNum is 0. In this case, the loop doesnâ€™t execute at all, and the function immediately returns 1. The runtime for this scenario is O(1), which means it runs in constant time.

### Worst Case Runtime
The worst case occurs when powNum is a large number. In this case, the loop executes powNum times. The runtime for this scenario is O(powNum), which means it runs in linear time relative to the value of powNum. 

#### Summary
Best Case: O(1) when powNum is 0.
Worst Case: O(powerNumber) when powerNumber is a large number.
