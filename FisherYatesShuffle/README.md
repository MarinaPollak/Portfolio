# Fisher-Yates Shuffle Program Summary

This program demonstrates the Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm by implementing a card shuffling system within a simple card game. The Fisher-Yates Shuffle is an efficient algorithm used to randomize the order of elements in a list, ensuring each permutation is equally likely.

## Key Components:

- Deck of Cards: The program represents a deck of cards as an array of strings, where each string represents a card (e.g., "Ace of Spades", "2 of Hearts", etc.).

- Fisher-Yates Shuffle: The program includes a template function (using a T function) to make the shuffle method more versatile. This allows the Fisher-Yates algorithm to shuffle any type of array, not just card arrays. The template enables the function to work with various types of collections, improving reusability and flexibility.

- Random Number Generator: A static, readonly instance of Random is used to ensure randomness. This avoids common issues with randomness, such as poor random number distribution when multiple instances of Random are created quickly.

- Card Game Simulation: After shuffling, the program prints out the shuffled deck, which can later be used in a card game simulation (such as War, Blackjack, or another card game).

Example Workflow:
The program initializes a deck of cards.
It applies the Fisher-Yates algorithm to shuffle the deck randomly using a template function for flexibility.
The shuffled deck is displayed to the user.
This project illustrates how to implement the Fisher-Yates shuffle in a way that supports various types of collections and demonstrates its use in real-world scenarios like card game simulations.
